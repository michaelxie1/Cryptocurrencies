# Cryptocurrencies
This project primarily utilizes unsupervised learning with the use of a dataset containing information on the value of cryptocurrencies. Before doing anything with the data, the first step was to preprocess everything and remove all the null values as well as any mixed data types that might interfere with the execution of the model. The information from the processed dataset will be utilized in the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm. The dimensions of the newly created data frame will be reduced and put into a new data frame. And finally, the K-means algorithm will be used to cluster the dataset. Utilizing the dataset, it was possible to see which cryptocurrencies would be the best to invest in currently, since companies such as BitCoin are unaffordable to the average consumer.
